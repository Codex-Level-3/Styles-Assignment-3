# Styles Assignment 3

## Objective

Combine React Bootstrap's component-based design with the utility-first CSS approach of Tailwind CSS to create a modern, responsive landing page. This assignment challenges you to leverage both frameworks within a Next.js project to construct a page that not only looks great but also scales well across devices. Additionally, deploy your finished product to Netlify to share your work with the world.

## Planet Landing Page

Welcome to the Planets Landing Page project! This is a modern, responsive landing page built with Next.js, React Bootstrap, and Tailwind CSS. The landing page showcases cards that display a short description about various planets in our solar system. Inspiration for this build was refrenced from NASA.

## Features

### Navbar

A navigation bar with links to different sections of the landing page.

- Home: Leads to the Landing Page.
- About: Leads to the NASA site I refrenced.
- Dropdown: Leads to the different sections within the landing page.

### Hero Section

The hero section contains a header, description, CTA button. It also utilizes Tailwind CSS hover on the button and backdrop blur features.

### Featured Planets

Showcases bootstrap cards implemented with Tailwind CSS styling, Framer Motion on load animations, and props. Each card displays an image, title, and brief description.

### Footer

Contains copyright information and link to my Github.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Reflection

Intergrating Next.js, React Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, and Framer Motion was a valuable learning experience. Understanding how they work together can improve my future projects building more reponsive web applications. One thing I would like to improve on is building better functional components that would allow reusability. Moving forward, the experience gained will serve as a foundation for tackling more complex web development challenges and refining skills in creating engaging user experiences.
